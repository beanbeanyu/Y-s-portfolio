            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Through studying in DT, I learned a lot of techniques. These techniques allowed me to not only stay in the 2D direction, but also explore 3D and interactive techniques, such as p5.js, Arduino, etc., enabling me to realize my wish of converting my 2D works into 3D step by step.</p>
