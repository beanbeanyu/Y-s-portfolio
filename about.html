    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Through studying in DT, I learned a lot of techniques. These techniques allowed me to not only stay in the 2D direction, but also let me learn a lot of 3D and interactive techniques, such as p5js, Arduino, etc., which allowed me to realize my wish of converting my 2D works into 3D step by step.</p>
    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <p>My name is Yan Yang, and I was born in Beijing, China. I came to the United States in the 10th grade of high school and spent my high school years in Utah.
